* emacs master experiments
This file is for notes about master emacs.

#+begin_example
git clone git@github.com:emacs-mirror/emacs.git

Because of the recent changes, I need to review my config. The Emacs Lisp
dialect changes give me warnings in my config. So I though about starting again
from scratch with a config targeted at master branch Emacs.

** compilation without installation
[[file:emacs/INSTALL::BASIC INSTALLATION]]

#+begin_example
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
./src/emacs -Q
./src/emacs --init-directory=/home/jacek/.emacs-master-experiment-1
#+end_example

** literal vs traditional code
I will not use [[file:~/.emacs.d-experimental/literal-config.org::*Literal config][Literal config]], but will consider it as a starting point for
packages selection and shortcuts.

** other Emacs configuration examples

** my mater init directory
file:~/.emacs-master-experiment-1/
