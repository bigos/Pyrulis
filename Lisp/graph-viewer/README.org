* Graph Viewer
A simple utility to view cons trees and other data structures. This is still
work in progress.

Assuming you can translate my paths to your system equivalents these
instructions may prove useful.

** REPL
#+begin_src lisp
  ;; example use
  (push #p"~/Programming/Pyrulis/Lisp/graph-viewer/" asdf:*central-registry*)
  (ql:quickload :graph-viewer)
  (graph-viewer:graph '(1 (2.1 . 2.2) 3))
#+end_src

** Adding to quicklisp
#+begin_example
cd /home/jacek/quicklisp/local-projects
ln -s /home/jacek/Programming/Pyrulis/Lisp/graph-viewer ./graph-viewer
#+end_example

** Interesting note on list circularity
http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/02_dhp.htm
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_dhp.htm

Has interesting documentation about *print-length* which can print circular
lists using "infinite" list notation.
