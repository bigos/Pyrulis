* Cairo references

  file:~/Programming/Pyrulis/Lisp/cairo-diagram/documentation/aaaaa-main.org::25
  and
  https://www.cairographics.org/manual/bindings-memory.html

  Refcounted opaque types all have a ..._reference() function to increase the
  refcount by one and a ..._destroy() to decrease the refcount by one. These
  should not be exposed to the user of the language binding, but rather used to
  implement memory management within the language binding.

** cairo-snake draw-canvas
   uses the not recommended function
   file:~/Programming/Pyrulis/Lisp/cairo-snake/cairo-snake.lisp::101

   If the bindings do not do it in the recommended way we will write a macro to
   fix that
