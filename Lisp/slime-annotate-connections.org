** slime code

*** variables
we have def connection vars
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::(slime-def-connection-var slime-connection-number nil]]
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::(slime-def-connection-var slime-lisp-implementation-type nil]]

possibly we could add another and around
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::defun slime-draw-connection-list (]]

we could use this as inspiration
file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::6421

and the values set at starting slime
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::setf (slime-connection-number proc) (cl-incf slime-connection-counter)]]
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::defun slime-set-connection-info (connection info]]
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20250817.2347/slime.el::(setf (slime-lisp-implementation-type) type]]
