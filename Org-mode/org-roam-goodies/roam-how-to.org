* Roam How To


This folder is for folders with org-roam notes.

There should be a symbolic link called current that points to one of those
folders and is used by Emacs configuration.

Make a new roam called ~diagram~ with updated link
#+begin_example
mkdir -p ./diagram/org-roam
rm ./current
ln -s ./diagram ./current
#+end_example

Start Emacs and run M-x org-roam-dired.

In the folder that opens run M-x org-roam-db-sync.

Press C-x n f and enter the name of your first node. Press C-c C-c to confirm.

I can switch between folders using the switch_project script. The script creates
symbolic link from the folder to current. The current is defined in the Emacs
config as the part of the path loading to org-roam folder with the org-roam data.
