#+Title: Literat

* Literat
** Introduction
 This is experiment using literate programming. Here we have only one file with
 Lisp code.

 The system that make this style of programming possible can be found here:
 https://github.com/jingtaozf/literate-lisp

 My version differs from the original documentation in skipping the use of
 polymode. Possibly, because I use the newer version of Emacs and org-mode. The
 *Raw* view on Github, in some circumstances, may show the first few lines
 incorrectly if you are adding more Lisp code above the line that starts with
 '# ' reader macro.

*** REPL use
Load the literate-lisp system and then load this file.

#+begin_example
  (ql:quickload :literate-lisp)
  (literate-lisp:with-literate-syntax  (load "~/Programming/Pyrulis/Lisp/LiterateLisp/literat.org"))
#+end_example

Evaluating this code in the REPL should print "Just saying hello"

This code can be tangled with:
#+begin_example
(literate-lisp:tangle-org-file "/home/jacek/Programming/Pyrulis/Lisp/LiterateLisp/literat.org")
#+end_example

** Code

*** eval-when
This is the example of loading libraries when the project is contained in one
file. Another example where literate-lisp and the dependencies are
invoked from asd file can be found [[https://github.com/jingtaozf/s-graphviz/blob/master/s-graphviz.asd][here]].

#+begin_src lisp
   (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
     (ql:quickload '(alexandria serapeum)))
#+end_src

*** Package
Define package
#+begin_src lisp
  (defpackage :literat
    (:use :cl))
#+end_src

And use it.
#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :literat)
#+end_src

*** Say Hello
define the function
#+begin_src lisp
  (defun say-hello ()
    (format t "~&Just saying hello~%"))
#+end_src

and call the function
#+begin_src lisp
  (say-hello)
#+end_src
