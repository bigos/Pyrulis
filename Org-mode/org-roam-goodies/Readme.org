I have Documetns/Roams in my home folder that contains folders that contain org-
roam folders inside them.

I can switch between folders using the switch_project script. The script creates
symbolic link from the folder to current. The current is defined in the Emacs
config as the part of the path loading to org-roam folder with the org-roam data.
