* Installing npm

I have a problem with old node and npm on Linux Mint.

** starting with a clean state

*** apt packages
#+begin_example
sudo apt purge nodejs
sudo apt autoremove
#+end_example

*** profiles
We need to review and clean up the profiles and logout when finished.

**** bash
Home folder bash profile files like .bashrc and .profile need to be reviewed and
any references to node or npm removed. That includes making sure the $PATH does
not include node or npm related entries.

**** other
Removed files: .npmrc
Removed folders: .npm, .npm-packages

** Installing nodejs

*** Install nvm
