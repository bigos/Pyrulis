** REPL prototyping and let

Following source example
#+begin_src elm
  withoutDashes str =
      let
          dash =
              '-'
          isKeepable character =
              character /= dash
      in
          String.filter isKeepable str
#+end_src

can be tried in REPL like this:
#+begin_example
> dash = '-'
> isKeepable character = character /= dash
> withoutDashes str = String.filter isKeepable str
#+end_example
