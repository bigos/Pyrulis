* Folder for custom Elisp code
To use it in your Emacs link the Emacs Lisp source files in this folder to a
folder that is in your *load-path*. I use *Emacs Prelude*, so the *vendor*
folder is a good choice, but if you use different method to configure Emacs
other appropriate folder that is in the *load-path* will do.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor/
ln -s ~/Programming/Pyrulis/Emacs/vendor/lfe-doc-finder.el .
#+END_EXAMPLE


Also do not forget to load such file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(load "lfe-doc-finder.el")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add it to your start-up or execute it in the scratch buffer.
