The essence of solving a problem is to find a language in which the solution is
obvious.

*** principles

Reduce components
Make systems of many appear fewer, symmetry, mental compression, proximity
Deepen understanding
No duplication unless it is a neighbour
Each distinct idea expressed separately
Highlight or hide

*** opposite principles
Copy pasted components
Countless components without any organisation, big ball of mud
Complexity eats understanding
Duplicates all over the place
Spaghetti mix

*** words

**** space
proximity
symmetry
proportions

**** count
fewer
reduced

**** clarity
distinct, clear, similar, blurred
