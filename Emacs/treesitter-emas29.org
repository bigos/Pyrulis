The Emacs News says we need treesitter library present when configuring and compiling emacs.

#+begin_example

#+end_example

Make sure you reload source configuration with
#+begin_example
./autogen.sh
./configure
#+end_example

Configure summary output should include
#+begin_example
Does Emacs use -ltree-sitter?                           yes
#+end_example

M-x ruby-ts-mode
gives
ruby-ts-mode: Tree-sitter for Ruby isnâ€™t available

https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-ruby
has the grammar

and this is the list of URLs for other languages
https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/

the Emacs News say:

Emacs provides a user command, that automates the download and build process of
a grammar libraries.

M-x tree-sitter-langs-install-grammars


Now when I open ruby file
M-x ruby-ts-mode
