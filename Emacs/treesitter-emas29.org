* Treesitter Emacs 29

The Emacs News says we need treesitter library present when configuring and compiling emacs.

#+begin_example
sudo apt install libtree-sitter-dev  
#+end_example


M-x ruby-ts-mode
gives
ruby-ts-mode: Tree-sitter for Ruby isnâ€™t available

https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-ruby
has the grammar


the Emacs News say:

Emacs provides a user command, 'treesit-install-language-grammar',
that automates the download and build process of a grammar library.
It prompts for the language, the URL of the language grammar's VCS
repository, and then uses the installed C/C++ compiler to build the
library and install it.

M-x treesit-install-language-grammar
Library installed to ~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter/libtree-sitter-ruby.so

Now when I open ruby file
M-x ruby-ts-mode
works
