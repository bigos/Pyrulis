  # will log both request and response, including bodies
  ENV['OAUTH_DEBUG'] = 'true'

This gem is a dependency of omni-auth2, so we can get the ever so helpful
debugging.

** omni-auth2

Consider ditching omni-auth2 for client applications. It seems that
https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth2
is a simpler solution

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Since you're using Docker, communication between apps is tricky. In short, they
are known by the names of the accounts and client services. Each has a specific
port.

For everything to be standard and less messy, put it in the / etc / hosts of
your host machine:

127.0.0.1 accounts client

And be careful to always access in the browser:

http: // accounts: 3001

http: // client: 3002

Register the application on accounts and update docker-compose.yml before you
start!
