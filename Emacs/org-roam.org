*** hardcoding
[[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-roam-20240114.1941/org-roam-graph.el::defun org-roam-graph--format-node (node type]]

Go to your elpa folder

#+begin_example
~/.emacs.d/elpa
#+end_example

search for defun:

#+begin_example
(defun org-roam-graph--format-node (node type)
#+end_example

see the 2nd line where label value node was commented out and replaced with substring
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq node-id node
        node-properties (append `(("label" . ,(concat type ":" (substring node (- (length node) 10))
                                          ;node
                                                      )))
                                (when (member type (list "http" "https"))
                                  `(("URL" . ,(xml-escape-string (concat type ":" node)))))))
