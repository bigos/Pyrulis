* Folder for custom Elisp code
To use it in your Emacs link the *.el files in this folder to a folder that is
in your *load-path*. I use *Emacs Prelude*, so vendor folder is a good choice, but
if you use different method to configure Emacs other appropriate folder that
that is in the *load-path* will do.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ln -s ./lfe-doc-finder.el ~/.emacs.d/vendor/
#+END_EXAMPLE
