I have Documetns/Roams in my home folder that contains folders that contain org-
roam folders inside them.

I can switch between folders using the switch_project script. The script creates
symbolic link from the folder to current. The current is defined in the Emacs
config as the part of the path loading to org-roam folder with the org-roam data.

In the Documents/Roams folder you can symlink the script using:

#+begin_example
  ln -s /home/jacek/Programming/Pyrulis/Org-mode/org-roam-goodies/switch_project ./switch_project
#+end_example
