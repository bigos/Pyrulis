* Installing from source

** required libraries
On system with existing installation we can find the installed dev libraries with

#+begin_example
sudo apt search "\-dev" | grep -E "^i\s"
#+end_example

This is my suggestion for Ubuntu based system
#+begin_example
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libgif-dev libgnutls28-dev libgtk-3-dev libjansson-dev libjpeg-dev libncurses-dev libtiff-dev libtinfo-dev libxpm-dev
#+end_example
