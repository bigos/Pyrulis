**** symbol-value
The function symbol-value takes a
symbol and returns the value of the corresponding special variable:

**** symbol-function
Beneath the surface, defun is setting the symbol-function of its first argu-
ment to a function constructed from the remaining arguments. The following two

(defun double (x) (* x 2))

(setf (symbol-function ’double)
  #’(lambda (x) (* x 2)))
