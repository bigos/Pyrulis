until you run out of ideas

importance of verbalising repeatedly

Can using org-roam-ui* functions help at this step?

** as much as you can expand ideas using domain language
until you can execute the pseudo-code in your head and you have clear terms for
the solution

The essence of solving a problem is to find a language in which the solution is
obvious.

The language tries to emerge from the subconscious.

*** principles

Reduce components
Make systems of many appear fewer, symmetry, mental compression, proximity
Deepen understanding
No duplication unless it is a neighbour
Each distinct idea expressed separately
Highlight or hide

*** opposite principles
Copy pasted components
Countless components without any organisation, big ball of mud
Complexity eats understanding
Duplicates all over the place
blurred concepts
Spaghetti mix

*** words

**** space
proximity
symmetry
proportions

**** count

reduced

**** clarity
