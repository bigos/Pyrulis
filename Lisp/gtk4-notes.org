#+begin_quote
Does the code work without gobj:object-unref? Some C examples of GTK involve it,
because C doesn't manage the memory automatically, forcing the programmer to
unref a object when it is no longer needed. But Lisp has GC and can unref the
unreachable objects at its own, so there is no point invoking gobj:object-unref
unless you are interacting with GTK through CFFI.
