I do not know how to have multiple roams easily. So I have prepared two scripts
that go with my Emacs config to park and unpark org-roam folders for easy
switching between them.

I have Documetns/Roams in my home folder that contains folders that contain org-
roam folders inside them. Running unpark.rb on a folder will extract the org-
roam inside it and copy it to Documents/org-roam.

Such folder copied to Documents/org roam should have park-at-path.rb script. You
must make sure if points to the right parking folder and edit before first use
if necessary. Such parking folder should correspond to the Roams folder from the
unpack.rb script.
